Title,Complete Steps to Reproduce,Expected Behavior,Observed (Buggy) Behavior,Assigned to:,Resolution Status,Resolution Notes
Search_Log Naming Structure is inconsistent/unclear,Read through search log + Messages from Trey ,Functions should be easy to read through and naming structure should be easy to understand,"1. xlsx variable name is hard to track, 2. too many comments, 3. inconsistent PEP-8 compliance, 4. missing an if __name__ == ""__main__"" block",Harvey Breaux,Resolved,"I've renamed and cleaned up the search log function.  The way it operates is more consistent, predictable, and clean. "
log_analyzer_gui is choosing the xlsx log database to use,"Read through log_analyzer, observe the analyze_log function passing the .xlsx to search_log()","The GUI program shouldn't be in charge of passing the search log to use by default.  The search log program should handle searching logic and functionality, and the GUI should just handle being a GUI","GUI program is passing the search log to use, and search_log should be choosing that instead. ",Harvey Breaux,Resolved,"search_log() has been updated and it no longer allows you to choose the log database.  It uses the same database each time, which is the desired functionality. "
No Unit Tests exist,n/a,There should be unit tests so that we can ensure no regressions occur,No unit tests currently in the Tests/Unit folder,Harvey Breaux,In Progress,"One unit test has been added, more are needed. "
